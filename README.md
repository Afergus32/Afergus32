- 👋 Hi, I’m @Afergus32
- 👀 I’m interested in learning cybersecurity and coding . I really want to end working at dead end jobs and start a new career were I can create stability and continue to grow in the IT world . I have also been looking into more crypto currencies since it is the new wave and feel like it will soon replace the current currency we use today. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning networking skills and learning how to be more confident in myself . 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help me learn how to code and be more efficient on my current IT skills that already have to offer.
- 📫 How to reach me : I can be reached at LinkedIn, Or my personal email which is Anika.Ferguson2@gmail.com.
